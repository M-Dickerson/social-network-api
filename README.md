# Social Network API

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to create a social media network through Insomnia. It solves the problem of not having a place where users can create profiles, as well as create, comment, and react to posts. I learned a lot about using Moment to create timestamps, as well as using MongoDB to create and test connections to databases.
